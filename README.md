StarLang Interpreter
====================

StarLang is a language we created at StarLeaf for a fun programming challenge.

It's designed to be pretty easy to implement with
- only two types
- * array
- * int
- minimal syntax 
- * Python inspired expressions
- * Curly brace blocks
- * function declaration and call
- * variable declaration (let) and assignment
- * if, while and return statements
- minimal intrinsic functions
- * new: To create arrays
- * len: To discover their size
- * putc: To write to stdout
- * getc: To read from stdin
- * exit: To exit

The standard library and most of the interesting examples are the work
of others.
